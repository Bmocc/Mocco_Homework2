For my HW2 assignment, I chose three different endpoints:

1. City Time

This allows the user to input a city ID, and get the current time.

            URL: ("https://wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi.com/v1/geo/cities/1/time")



2. Country Details

This allows the user to input a country ID and see the name, capital, calling code, and number of regions of that country.

            URL: "https://wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi.com/v1/geo/countries/" 



3. City Details

This allows the user to input a city ID and get the name, population, and country of that city.

            URL: "https://wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi.com/v1/geo/cities/"
